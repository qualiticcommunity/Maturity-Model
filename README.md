# Maturity Model
Maturity Model is a proposal made by a few senior software developers to help people measure and improve their quality. Off course the model itself is going to improve by developers. By developers, for developers.

## Quality Development
Quality Development is a new approach to check the quality of a product. It focuses on affecting individual developers and setting up their mindset with quality concepts.

## Introduction
Fast development of a high-quality product is the concern of almost all software companies. At first glance, it seems like a trade-off; having an ideal quality versus releasing fast. However, some claim the quality and the speed of development, not only aren't trade-offs, but also boost each other.  
The Maturity Model is trying to provide a roadmap for progressing in quality.

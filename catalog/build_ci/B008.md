|**Code**           | **B008** |
|**Title**          | No manual configuration of CI/CD agent machines. |
|**Description**    | Provisioning the required environment of the pipeline agents is derived from the code base. i.e. there is no tacit knowledge about how to setup/configure an agent for the project. |
|**Best Practices** | An interactive script at the root of repository that asks for a bare server info (e.g. ip/user/password) and then sets up runners on the specified targets automatically.|

|**Applied stage**  | |

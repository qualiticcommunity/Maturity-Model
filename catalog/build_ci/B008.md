### B008

|**Code**           | **B008** |
|**Title**          | No manual configuration of CI/CD agent machines. |
|**Description**    | Provisioning the required environment of the pipeline agents is derived from the code base. i.e. there is no tacit knowledge about how to setup/configure an agent for the project. |
|**Best Practices** | One approach is to add an interactive script to the repository root that asks for a bare server info (e.g. ip/user/password) and then sets up agents on the specified targets, automatically. <br/>It's recommended to also containerize (e.g. dockerize) the pipeline jobs, to narrow down the agent machine configs. |
